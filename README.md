## Deciding where to open a new venue in London (outside Inner City Limits)

London is a great city. It is diverse, multicultural and full of opportunities. But there is also another side to its popularity and appeal. London is an expensive place to live and thrive. Many businesses want to open a venue here and many pay top price to have their window on Piccadilly or Oxford Street. But what about those, who want to start their own business and cannot really afford to open in the City yet? Where is it best to open a new place?
